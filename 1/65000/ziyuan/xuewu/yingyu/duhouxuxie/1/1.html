        <p>Jeff and I had many conversations during this year,but I will always remember the time he told me about his family。His father, a successful physician, was cold and strict in Jeff's words. His father had even paved the way for Jeff to attend the same, college, from, which, he, had, graduated。
        <p>Jeff was 27 and successful business planner at a company --without a degree. His passion was skiing .When he graduated from his high school,he decided to decline his father's offer and instead to work with a ski patrol.With pain in his eyes, jeff told me he still remember the day when he told his father he was going to give up college and take a job at a skill resort</p>
        <p>Hearing Joe's decision, his father looked off into the distance.Then came the word that still echoed in Jeff's mind:"You lazy kid. No son of mine is going to work with a ski patrol and does not attend college.I should have known you'd never amount to anything!"The two had not spoken since that conversation.</p>
        <p>Later, he was back in the area near where he grew up and he certainly did not want his father to know he was attending college.He was doing this for himself, not for his father.He said it over and over again.Jeff sister had always reminded supportive of jeff's decision.She stayed in a contract with their father, but Jeff had made her promise that she would not share any information about his life with him.</p>
        <p>The day when the graduation ceremony came, I walked around talking to people before it started, I noticed a man with a confused expression.</p>
        <p>"Excuse me,"he said as he politely approached me."What is happenning here today?"</p>
        <p>"It's graduation day,"I replied,smiling."Well,that's odd,"he said,"my daughter asked me to meet her at this address."His eyes sparkled and he smiled."Maybe she completed her associate's degree and wanted to surprise me!"I helped him find a seat.</p>

        <strong>Paragraph 1:</strong><span>As I left him,he said,"Thank you.By the way,my name is Dr. Holstrom</span>
        <div class="en">Wait,！That Doctor Holstrom? I immediately caught on to what's going on here-the carefully-arranged surprised was meant to bridge the huge and undersired gap between father and son.Instead of walking away, I grabbed a seat near Dr. Holstrom to keep him company and to witness this remarkable moments unfold.A few minutes later.Jeff's sister turned up without the expected cap and gown(长袍).A hint of uneasiness invoice. She broke the thrilling news to her father.The slightly trembling hands betrayed the father's excitement and mixed emotion, with his eyes glued to the graduates walking on the stage.</div>

    <div>
        <strong>Paragraph 2:</strong><span>Jeff was the last person to cross the stage.</span>
        <div class="en">Having taken over his certificate and shaken hands with the principal, he turned to scan the crowd for us.When the two locked eyes, a mistiness settled in their gaze.The once stern and unyielding father,whom Jeff had once defined was now clapping and cheering for his sons achievement,an achievement accomplished without his direct involvement.The ceremony over,Jeff came running to us. Dr. Holstrom approached his son and embrace him.The thing standing between the two for years was finally torned down.I captured a picture of Jeff tossing his head in the air next to his father and sister, the gleam of happiness sparking in the eyes of the approved son.</div>
